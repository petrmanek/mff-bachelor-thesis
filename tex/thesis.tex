\def\Abstract{
Imitating the process of natural selection, evolutionary algorithms have shown to be efficient search techniques for optimization and machine learning in poorly understood and irregular spaces. In this thesis, we implement a library containing essential implementation of such algorithms in recently unveiled programming language Swift. The result is a lightweight framework compatible with Linux-based computing clusters as well as mobile devices. Such wide range of supported platforms allows for successful application even in situations, where signals from various sensors have to be acquired and processed independently of other devices. In addition, thanks to Swift's minimalistic and functional syntax, the implementation of bundled algorithms and their sample usage clearly demonstrates fundamentals of genetic programming, making the work usable in teaching and quick prototyping of evolutionary algorithms.
