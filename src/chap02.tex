\section{Data Structures}
In this section, the data structures capable of holding genetic information are described. To help first-time users, the library includes implementation of several types, commonly used in genetic programming. It does however also include a set of requirements in the form of Swift interfaces, which allow advanced users to implement their own dedicated data structures and customize their behavior.

Users are thus free to choose, whether they wish to utilize already implemented data structures or create their own. Moreover, data structures distributed along with the library also support nesting. Users can combine them in whatever way in order to form more complex structures.
